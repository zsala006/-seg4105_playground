SEG4105 Lab 08 - StandUp

## Stand Up Summary

Zakariya Salad - 300005501
I researched and implemented draggable waypoints using deck.gl layers
for the job review panel in JAMZ. I implemented this using the built in
ondrag, ondragstart, and ondragend event listeners and updated data points
by using REACT useState and useCallback. I will investigate how to utiilize
websockets to retrieve data from the backend so once a job is edited, accepted,
or rejected, I can update that data accordingly. I will implement unit tests to
confirm the functionality of the job review panel.
